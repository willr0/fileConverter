Command line tool which accepts either .txt or .bin file and converts them respectably. 

Functions:

-t [textToBin]: [executable] -t [.txt] [.bin]
Converts the specified .txt file to a .bin file of the name given

-b [binToText]: [executable] -b [.bin] [.txt]
Converts the specified .bin file to a .txt file of the name given

-s [binToStats]: [executable] -s [.bin]
Prints information about the .bin file 

(NOTE: As this was an assignment for a class, -s is really only useful in the given scenario with files provided by the instructor. I am including this to showcase the code itself)
